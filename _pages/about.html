      <p>Computer dork meets social butterfly. This unique personality of opposites allows me to successfully combine serious work skills while multi-tasking with style and ease. Combine the diplomacy of Madeline Albright with the humanitarian vision of President Jimmy Carter and add the flexibility of Spider-Man and you've got me.</p>
      <p>You've heard it all before&mdash;a guy with small town Michigan roots moves to the big city to chase his dreams but instead finds jobs stuffing envelopes and foaming lattes. So I hit the books and keyboard at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago for a BA in Fine Arts, and now I design and redesign in my sleep.</p>
      <p>I taught myself HTML &amp; CSS, applied my knowledge to front-end web design and fell in love with building websites. After years of freelance work and a brief period with the Obama Reelection Campaign, I joined Coyote Logistics in 2011 and eventually grew into Lead Product Designer, building a massive web app and several mobile apps for Coyote's customers.</p>
      <p>In 2016 I joined Amazon in Seattle, WA, designing delivery tools for drivers and partner companies. 4 years later I transferred to the Amazon Explore team designing streaming interfaces for customers and hosts.</p>
