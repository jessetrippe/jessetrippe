<p>Among Amazon's many delivery solutions is a network of 3rd-party courier companies delivering from Amazon-branded vans to customers' doors. Dispatchers at these companies had to be on-site at Amazon delivery stations to complete dispatching tasks and were largely blind to their fleets' progress. They needed a tool to monitor location, progress, route, and stop information and Amazon needed a tool to collect daily rosters. The new tool had to combine features and information that was previously spread among many different, clunky tools in an efficient and simple way.</p>
<p>The Product Manager was new to Amazon's shipping space so my logistics expertise, business knowledge, and field observations were vital to defining all aspects of this tool. From receiving the project to launching in beta form, the project took 6 months and is being used by all Amazon 3rd-party dispatchers and managers across North America. The tool will launch worldwide in early 2018.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>In order to define our users and their needs for this tool, a Product Manager and I traveled to different delivery stations to observe users (painfully) completing dispatching tasks. We also had meetings with Amazon operations teams to understand their needs and then developed a timeline and scope for the project. I wireframed a handful of ideas, and, along with the Product Manager, decided on a design approach to move forward with. I then took these wireframes to a local delivery station to test my assumptions and get feedback.</p>

<h2>Final Design</h2>
<p>The final tool allows dispatchers to see where routes are, where drivers are, and quickly spot and triage exceptions. This enables 3rd-party companies to establish and more fully optimize their operations. The final designs were taken to a delivery station and presented to users for further feedback. This feedback influenced changes that were either implemented into the product or added to a future feature list.</p>
