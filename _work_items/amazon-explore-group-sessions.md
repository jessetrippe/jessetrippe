Amazon Explore launched in June of 2020 with great customer satisfaction scores (4.8/5) but extremely low conversion (1.2%). One factor for this (determined by customer surveys) was the high price for experiences (average price $52.50). Adding the ability for sellers to deliver group sessions - one host to a small group of strangers - would drive the price down considerably to a target average price of $17.00.

## Kickoff and research

Initial discussions kicked off between myself and the product manager to discuss a rough timeline. Designs and requirements were quickly needed to receive tech scoping and provide a timeline for Amazon leadership. We worked simultaneously with frequent check-ins to accommodate this urgency.

I hosted ongoing brainstorming sessions with the Product Manager and an Engineering Lead. We discussed high-level, obvious requirements from both customers' and guides' perspectives (e.g. viewing other attendees, muting, microphone meters, scheduling, etc.) while simultaneously researching competitor solutions.

## Wireframes

After presenting and critiquing the competitive analysis, we aligned on a handful of features and a rough design approach. I began wireframing ideas on both the customer and guide UIs.

I presented many of these to design peers for critique and to generate additional design ideas. Eventually, I presented a limited number of wireframes to the Product Manager for collaboration and feedback.

## Further iteration

After meeting with fellow designers and the Product Manager and failing to reach a consensus on an approach, I moved into slightly higher fidelity and focused on the best solutions from the wireframes.

## Final Design &amp; Prototype

The final solution for the customer side leaned on our tenet of building and maintaining presence and essentially getting out of the way so a customer can feel immersed in the streamed environment. We used a similar solution to Zoom - a black row to house attendees and corresponding microphone and raised-hand statuses - but placed it at the bottom in a thin strip to maximize video stream size. Showing statuses to all attendees as well as the guide should help facilitate fluid communication between all participants.

This was launched to beta participants in early June. CSAT scores maintain above 4 but dipped lower than private sessions to 4.4. The average price of all experiences dropped to $24.25 and the average group experience price is $14.41, below our target price for group sessions.

The final solution for guides also leans heavily into getting UI elements out of the way but for a different reason than customers. Guides' primary focus needs to be delivering great live experiences, focusing on the narration and their environment as opposed to their app. An equally important focus is their safety while walking through busy streets and sidewalks.

To add more features to the app, reduce UI clutter, and increase video size I moved shopping and in-session content into a curtain that can be toggled open and closed, and then added the new attendee list. The list also has tappable elements for guides to mute and unmute customers, and view raised-hand status. The solution heavily relies on toast notifications and sounds previously designed by myself for the app.

## Feedback and updates

After releasing this to guides in beta form and collecting feedback, I discovered two key insights on top overwhelmingly positive reviews: 1. In outdoor lighting with various darkness of the background stream, the icons can be hard to see at gimbal distance. 2. The icons which toggle the menu are placed too close to the device's selfie camera, blocking the stream while in that mode.

With this last iteration, I addressed both concerns.
