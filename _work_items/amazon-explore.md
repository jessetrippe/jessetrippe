Amazon Explore is a virtual tour product consisting of guides (local experts) who sell virtual experiences on a new Amazon marketplace for customers to enjoy from their couch.

My responsibilities include sole ownership of the customer in-session streaming UX/UI design (including audio/video controls, alerts and communication messaging, shopping confirmation, and multi-user support) and the  UX/UI design of the app our experts use to deliver these experiences (including providing scheduling, hardware checks, playing in-session media content, creating shopping carts, receiving alerts and messaging, etc.).
