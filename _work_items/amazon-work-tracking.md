Due to various unforeseen complications throughout the day, the work Amazon planned for 3rd-party courier companies to complete and eventually invoice Amazon for changed drastically. Amazon needed a tool to allow these companies to review and submit driver hours and route counts daily in order to reduce invoicing disputes, inaccuracies, and speed up payments from Amazon.

Prior to my involvement, this project launched in beta form to three UK delivery stations where it failed because too many untested assumptions proved to be wrong. I was brought on to work with and mentor a junior designer in order to provide a solution that successfully met the users' and Amazon's needs for a work tracking tool. The redesign took around 3 months to complete and involved a visit to the UK with a prototype I built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test with users using real data.

## Wireframes

After getting up to speed on the goals of the product and how the beta failed, the initial designer and I conducted several interviews with beta testers to uncover pain points and frustrations. The beta failed due to an assumption about how users collect, record, and maintain daily route counts and mileage so the new solution had to support all the various ways this was being done.

I wireframed layouts that organized the collection of work in different ways and then reached out to the same beta testers for feedback. I used the wireframes to ensure the right information was being displayed to complete the task without overwhelming them with unnecessary stats and metrics.

## Final Design &amp; Prototype

Once the wireframe and overall approach were settled, we divided the design work between both designers and built pixel-perfect designs while syncing often. Because of the failures of the initial launch, after the design was somewhat complete, I built a working prototype using actual data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and traveled to the UK to test at the three beta stations. The new tool succeeded where the previous failed and also proved far more efficient. We collected feedback and made changes to many of the smaller details but overall the prototype and design were successful.
