I joined the Barack Obama Reelection Campaign as a Front-End Developer. My responsibilities included the creation and maintenance of donation forms including front-end form validation, error handling, embedded video, mobile layout considerations, A/B testing, and constant modifications and troubleshooting.

I was also solely solely responsible for the development of the campaign's Tumblr which required learning Tumblr's templating language as well as defining mobile breakpoints and layouts.
