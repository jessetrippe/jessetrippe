<p class="max-w-2xl mb-6">Working with the content of their original website, I designed and coded an extensive portfolio and blog for Chicago architecture firm BauerLatoza Studio. The final design needed to fit within the company's already designed logo, letterhead, invoicing and marketing materials. The result is a site with modern navigation, improved functionality throughout, and easier on the eye without getting in the way of their amazing work.</p>
