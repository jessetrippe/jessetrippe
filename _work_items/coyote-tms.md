<p class="max-w-2xl mb-6">While at Coyote I worked on many different projects, the largest of which was their business-to-business Transportation Management System (TMS). Working with a team of 20 developers, I was responsible for every page's overall design and user interface, the implementation, development, and maintenance of the app's CSS framework and HTML, and the occasional copy-writing. This required great effective communication, teamwork, and an acute attention to detail. As with most projects at Coyote, my responsibilities on this project grew to span across many roles including Business Analyst, Quality Assurance Tester, UX Designer, and UI Designer.</p>
