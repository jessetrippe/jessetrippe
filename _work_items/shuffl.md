<p>A friend built a small Slack app that paired employees together and set up a day and time to get lunch as a way to promote inter-office communication. As the product grew in usage and time passed, the tool's marketing website began to collect dust informationally and visually. I gave the website a refresh of both the content and the design. This improved the visitor to install ratio drastically and made the owner much more proud of their app.</p>
